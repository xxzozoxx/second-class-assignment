            <h2>Why Recycle?</h2>
            <p>Cooking oil that is poured down the sink or drain ends up in our waterways where is becomes an environmental
                hazard. It can also block drains and choke up sewer systems and water treatment facilities. Instead, used
                cooking oil can be effectively recycled into a number of secondary products including bio-diesel. Bio-diesel
                is a clean burning fuel alternative to petroleum diesel and helps reduce reliance on petroleum products and
                reduce emissions from the transport sector.
